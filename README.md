You can run this code on your local machine by setting up a Python environment. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:

1. **Install Python**: If you don't have Python installed on your computer, download and install the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to add Python to your system's PATH during the installation.

2. **Install Required Libraries**: Open a terminal or command prompt and install the necessary libraries using pip, Python's package manager. In this case, you'll need to install the yfinance library. Enter the following command:

   ```
   pip install yfinance pandas
   ```

   This will install yfinance and pandas, which are needed to run the code you provided.

3. **Set Up Python Script**: Create a new Python file (e.g., `stock_analysis.py`) and paste the code you provided into it.

4. **Run the Script**: To run the script, navigate to the directory where the Python file is located using the terminal or command prompt. Then, simply execute the script by entering:

   ```
   python stock_analysis.py
   ```

   This will run the code, and you should see the output of the various statements in the terminal.

Please note that this code relies on the yfinance library to fetch financial data from Yahoo Finance. Keep in mind that Yahoo Finance's API may have usage limitations or might change over time. If you encounter any issues with the yfinance library or data retrieval, check the official documentation or the library's GitHub page for updates.

Also, be cautious when running code that fetches financial data, as it may be subject to usage restrictions or rate limits imposed by the data provider (Yahoo Finance, in this case). Always comply with the terms of service of the data provider to avoid any potential issues.
